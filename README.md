# MangaMine
Will be able to sift through a variety of Manga sites and download pages and order based on chapter. Currently 
only supports MangaPanda fully. Has the ability to start from a chapter that the user chooses. Also has the ability
to download a specific range of chapters.

Bato only has the ability to download full manga and still quite a few bugs.

Currently all manga sites have seperate python files, once they are all done we will combine them into a single file.

Supports Windows, Linux and Mac.
