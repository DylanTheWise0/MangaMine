Added a basic search feature for MangaPanda. Currently case sensitive, the manga name needs to match the name 
exactly as it is on the site for the search to work. Also ensured created directory names will use valid characters.

Added Linux and Mac support. Changed the way outputting "Downloading Page #" works. Now each print statment overwrites
the last via a carriage return to keep clutter down. Changed name to MangaMine (MangaPanda).py in order to keep Manga
websites seperated until they are all fleshed out, will combine later.
